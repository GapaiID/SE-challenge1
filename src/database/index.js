        "body": "JSON, short for JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data interchange format that has become the go-to choice for transmitting and storing data in web applications. Its simplicity and human-readable format make it easy for both humans and machines to work with. But why should you care about JSON in the context of your web development projects? JSON is the glue that holds together the data in your applications. It’s the language in which data is communicated between servers and clients, and it’s the format in which data is stored in databases and configuration files. In essence, JSON plays a pivotal role in modern web development. Understanding JSON and its nuances is not only a fundamental skill for any web developer but also crucial for optimizing your applications. As we delve deeper into this blog, you’ll discover why JSON can be a double-edged sword when it comes to performance and how this knowledge can make a significant difference in your development journey.",

        "body": "Almost two years ago, I wrote a blog post comparing React Native and Flutter at a time when I was still somewhat new to Flutter. I had spoken very highly of it, but also paid some respect to React Native. I had more experience with React Native and loved (and still do) its web OG, ReactJS. Almost two years later, I will say that I have become far less impartial. Long story short, I feel that FLUTTER is absolutely the better mobile framework. Yep. I said it. Flutter is easily the superior mobile framework. I get it, a lot of it has to do with each individual, their development and learning style, goals, etc. From my personal experience, as well as the experience of a few mobile devs in my network, Flutter is simply more streamlined than React Native. This efficiency is apparent in Flutter’s growing popularity. So you might be wondering, then, why React Native continues to be so popular? Well, I have a theory, consisting of two big catalysts.",

        "body": "Optimizing JavaScript performance is not a trivial task, and this article will show you how to tackle one problem involving large arrays and many operations, going from a first (slow) version to a (much optimized) final one, discussing many good and bad options along the way. In our previous articles we saw two distinct ways to optimize long array operations… but which is better? Without paying attention to actual performance, we could note that the first (very functional!) solution, using transducers, could be considered complex and somewhat challenging to understand. On the other hand, the more straightforward solution, without transducers, was longer but arguably clearer. In any case, that’s not what worries us; after all, usage was similar for both solutions, so their internal complexity isn’t significant. We need to compare both solutions in terms of performance and maybe try to optimize them to the maximum so we can decide which way to go.",

        "body": "I don’t have a relationship with my blood family. Some connections were broken by me, and some by them. Either way, it was always for the best, and honestly, I don’t miss any of them, including those who have passed on. Some children become obsessed with the idea that they may have been adopted. I always knew I was related to the members of my family; there was no doubt about that, but I also felt like I was born into the wrong family. I did not belong with them. I did not belong to them. Maybe that’s why I didn’t bear children. Perhaps I didn’t want to pass along genes that never felt like mine. Maybe I was afraid of birthing a child who was more like my family than me. Then, what would I do? It’s one thing to let go of relatives and another to let go of your own child. At the age of 49, I adopted a runaway teenage girl originally from Honduras. At the age of 53, she made me a grandmother. I’ve heard grandparents say they looked at their newborn grandchild and imagined all the ancestors who came before. They felt a deep, visceral bond to that baby, an attachment that went back generations. As I stood in the delivery room watching my grandson being born, I was overwhelmed with feelings of love and connection, but also a relief. Relief that he didn’t carry my genetic baggage. Relief that he wouldn’t grow up to remind me of my father. Relief that he was related to me by love and not by blood. I felt a bond that was arguably as strong as that of any grandparent but one that didn’t go back beyond me, one that involved only him, his mother, and me. A connection that felt as fresh and pure as he was.",

        "body": "A planet that shouldn’t exist” Kepler-16 b challenges expectations and theories about planet formation and the environment since it is the existence of Kepler-16 b that goes against the grain. let’s explore the mystifying properties that set this fascinating planet that shouldn’t exist separately. Defying the Odds of Planetary Formation As an earth-sized, circumbinary planet orbiting two stars, Kepler-16b checks off not one but two major boxes that make its very existence seem unlikely. Firstly, its dual solar system: Kepler-16b remarkably orbits around two stars at once — a pairing of a K-type orange dwarf and an M-type red dwarf that orbit each other every 41 days. According to theories of planetary formation, the turbulent environment created by binary star systems tends to destroy planetesimal disks before planets can fully form. Yet Kepler-16b is right there. The second unlikely factor is Kepler-16b’s size so close to its two parent stars. At only 20% larger than Earth, it is considered an earth-sized planet. Small, rocky worlds were expected to form much farther out from binary pairs where volatile materials like water could condense. But Kepler-16b bucks these assumptions by being an earth-sized sister planet discovered in the boiling-hot orbit between two stars. An orbit that theoretically shouldn’t allow such terrestrial worlds to accumulate.",

        "body": "Emotions are the backbone of relationships. We’ve often heard about the importance of being open about our emotions in developing healthy relationships with others. However, based on what I’ve been through, I believe that sharing every bit of our feelings can backfire. Let’s see why. The Burden of Emotional Dumping Sharing your emotions places a responsibility on the shoulders of the other person. Imagine that person who, whenever you come across them, starts to share their frustration with you. Talking with such a person always forces us to feel compelled to empathize with their negative emotions. In dealing with them, we always should come up with the best answer to prove to them why their frustration is valid in their case. This is a very energy-consuming process for most of us. As a result, you don’t enjoy being around that person, leading to a deterioration in your relationship. Loss of Privacy The essence of effective communication is understanding and empathizing with the other person’s emotions. However, overdoing it can come with a hefty cost: Crossing our personal boundaries. Every needs personal space in their life which doesn’t include any other person. By sharing every emotion you have, you’re inviting others into that personal space, leading to a loss of privacy. As you have no privacy in any aspect of your life, there are no personal boundaries in your relationships. Where there are no boundaries, there is no respect and intimacy.",
